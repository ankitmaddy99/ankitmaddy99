👋 Hi, I’m @ankitmaddy99 (but you can call me Maddy)
👀 I’m interested in… learning new things faster than my Wi-Fi can load.
🌱 I’m currently learning… AI, so when robots rise, I’ll be their favorite human.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on… anything cool, preferably with caffeine and good vibes.
📫 How to reach me… through my GitHub profile, or via carrier pigeon if you’re feeling retro.
😄 Pronouns: Code/Nap/Repeat (it’s a lifestyle, really)
⚡ Fun fact: I can open 50 tabs, forget why I opened them, and still convince myself I’m being productive.
