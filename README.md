👋 Hi, I’m @ankitmaddy99
👀 I’m interested in… learning new things faster than my Wi-Fi can load.
🌱 I’m currently learning… AI, so when robots take over, I’ll be on their good side.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on… anything cool, as long as coffee is involved.
📫 How to reach me… through my GitHub profile, or send a carrier pigeon if you’re old-school.
😄 Pronouns: Code/Nap/Repeat
⚡ Fun fact: I can open 50 tabs and still forget why I opened the first one.
